These are some of my previous/current projects. Some of the current projects I am working on more actively. Others are more of a side project that I try to play around with when I can but are usually on the back burner.

# Current Projects

* This website
    + My main goal is to get more posts up, mostly tutorials and simple data analyses.
    + I would also like to learn more about web development so I can customize the site a bit more.
    + I would also like to get a better understanding of how exactly Hugo and Blogdown work.
    
* Bayesian Python
    + I have two goals for this project: (1) learn more Python and (2) develop a set of  functions to implement some of the models covered in a Bayesian statistics course I recently took.
    + The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/bayes-stats). There isn't much to it now because of higher priorities but hopefully I can get more done soon.
    
    
# Previous Projects
    
* Adventures In Bayesian Structural Time Series
    + This was a group project about Bayesian time series models for a course I took.
    + We created a series of video tutorials covering the theory and implementation in `R`.
    + The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/bayes-time-series). The videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWHTeWZGJD5ZOYv3HFsUgQG0CnPRVycbu&jct=rLRp14kqRdyMaj9ax612ar_YeSt0gQ&disable_polymer=true).
