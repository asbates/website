# San Diego R Users Group

I recently started an 
  [R user group in San Diego](https://www.meetup.com/sd-r-users/).
We've only had one meeting so far but plans are in the works for more.
I started this group so San Diego R users can get together, learn from each 
  other, and talk about all the great things R has to offer.
R has a fantastic online community and I want to help establish that at a local
  level.
  
# Seefood Shiny App

I made a Shiny application based on the
  [Seefood](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACmydtFDTGs) app from HBO's
  _Silicon Valley_.
Given an image, it predicts whether the image is a hot dog or 'not hot dog'.
I built a Keras model on Paperspace and wrapped it in a Shiny application.
You can find the app [here](https://asbates.shinyapps.io/hotdog/) and
  the modeling code
  [here](https://github.com/asbates/neural-nets/tree/master/not-hotdog).
  
# R package geblm

I have an R package called 
  [geblm](https://github.com/asbates/geblm) that implements some research of a
  previous professor.
It implements new MCMC algorithms for Bayesian linear and liner mixed models that 
  converge geometrically.
It still needs some work (mainly documentation) but unfortunately I just 
  haven't had the time.
I did learn a lot, however, like using C++ with Rcpp, writing unit tests, and
  generally how R packages work.


# R Workshops at SDSU

I did a few workshops for a student organization, the Society of Statisticians 
  and Actuaries, when I was a student at SDSU.
I gave workshops on an introduction to R, data wrangling with dplyr, data
  visualization with ggplot2, and an introduction to Git & GitHub.
Materials can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/ssa_r_workshops).
This was a great experience because it forced me to think hard about what I 
  think is important about each topic/tool and why others should care.
  
# Adventures In Bayesian Structural Time Series

I did a group project for a Bayesian statisics course where we were tasked with
  making video tutorials on a topic of our choosing.
We talked about the theory behind Bayesian structural time series and showed
  how to implement the theory with the 
  [bsts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/index.html) package.
We had a ton of fun with this project!
The videos had a DnD/adventure theme where viewers were on quest to learn about
  the topic (we may have went a little overboard with this theme :smile:).
The videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWHTeWZGJD5ZOYv3HFsUgQG0CnPRVycbu&jct=rLRp14kqRdyMaj9ax612ar_YeSt0gQ&disable_polymer=true) and all the materials we
  used can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/bayes-time-series).
