This is a list of my current projects along with a description. Some of them I am working on more actively (because it's a school project for example) and others are more of a side project that I work on when I have the time.

* This website
    + My main goal is to get more posts up, especially data analyses.
    + I would also like to learn more about web development so I can customize the site a bit more.
    
* Bayesian Structural Time Series
    + This is a group project about Bayesian time series models for a Bayesian statistics course I'm currently taking.
    + The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/bayes-time-series).
    + Some video tutorials we are making can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBaPaHRPTgc&t=0s).
    + This is a work in progress and we welcome any comments/suggestions.
    
* Bayesian Python
    + I have two goals for this project: (1) learn Python and (2) develop a set of transparent functions for simple Bayesian analyis (by transparent I mean actually knowing what's happening instead of letting e.g. JAGS determine a sampling algorithm without telling you what it's doing)
    + The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/bayes-stats). There isn't much to it now because of higher priorities but hopefully I can get more done soon.
