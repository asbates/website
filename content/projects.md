These are some of my previous/current projects. Some of the current projects I am working on more actively. Others are more of a side project that I try to play around with when I can but are usually on the back burner.

# Current


* R workshops
  + I'm doing a series of R workshops for the Society of Statisticians and Actuaries at SDSU.
  + In fall 2018 it was introduction to R, dplyr, and ggplot2.
  + In the spring I'm hoping to do Git/GitHub, more tidyverse, blogdown, and SQL.
  + All the materials are available [here](https://github.com/asbates/ssa_r_workshops).

* R package
  + I'm currently working on an R package implementing some recent research in Bayesian statistics.
  + It uses Markov chains that converge geometrically (read: fast) which allows us to estimate things like MCMC standard errors.
  + The heavy computation is being implemented in C++ via Rcpp and RcppEigen.
  + You can find it on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/asbates/geblm).
  
  
* This website
    + My main goal is to get more posts up, mostly tutorials and some data analyses.
    + I would also like to get a better understanding of how exactly Hugo and Blogdown work.

<!--
* Bayesian Python
    + I have two goals for this project: (1) learn more Python and (2) develop a set of  functions to implement some of the models covered in a Bayesian statistics course I recently took.
    + The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/bayes-stats). There isn't much to it now because of higher priorities but hopefully I can get more done soon.

# Previous
    
* Adventures In Bayesian Structural Time Series
    + This was a group project about Bayesian time series models for a course I took.
    + We created a series of video tutorials covering the theory as well as implementation in `R`.
    + The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/asbates/bayes-time-series). The videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWHTeWZGJD5ZOYv3HFsUgQG0CnPRVycbu&jct=rLRp14kqRdyMaj9ax612ar_YeSt0gQ&disable_polymer=true).
