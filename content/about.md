Hi! My name is Andrew. Welcome to my website! I use this as a place to collect
 and share some of my thoughts on statistics and R. 
I also use it to record new things I learn in case my future self forgets some 
 of the details. It was built using the R package
 [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) using the 
 [Hugo Lithium](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme) theme with some 
 minor modifications.

For about two years I worked as a data analyst at a bank.
I did quite a lot there including ad-hoc analyses, ETL, exploratory modeling,
 and writing R packages for our group.
I also did a lot of work towards establishing better practices for our team
 like improving documentation and using version control.

Before that, I got a master's in statistics from San Diego State University
 and a bachelor's in applied math from UC San Diego.
I was mostly interested in computer-intensive statistical methods, time series
 analysis, and of course R!

Before entering college I spent 6 years in the Navy where I worked in nuclear
  power.
I was responsible for maintaining steam and reactor plant chemistry and for
 supervising radiological controls.
