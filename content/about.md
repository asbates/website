Hi! My name is Andrew. Welcome to my website! It's a place for me to collect and share some of my thoughts on statistics and R. I also use it to record new things I learn in case my future self forgets some of the details. It was built using the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) using the [Hugo Lithium](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme) theme with some minor modifications.


I've been doing data analysis at Axos Bank since May 2018.
Lately I've been working on things like writing internal R packages and 
  establishing best pracices such as using version control and improving 
  documentation.
I recently graduated from San Diego State University with a master's in 
  statistics.
My main interests are computational statics, time series analysis, and of
  course R!
Before entering college I spent 6 years in the Navy where I worked in nuclear
  power.
