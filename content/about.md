Hi! My name is Andrew Bates and this is my website. It's mostly about statistics and R. It was built using the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) using the [Hugo Lithium](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme) theme with some minor modifications.

I'm currently a master's student at San Diego State Univeristy where I am studying statistics. My main interests are computational statistics, time series analysis, and Bayesian statistics. I can be contacted by email [here](mailto:andrewbates73@gmail.com).
