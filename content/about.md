Hi! My name is Andrew Bates and this is my website. It's a place for me to collect and share some of my thoughts on statistics and R. I also use it to record new things I learn in case my future self forgets some of the details. It was built using the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) using the [Hugo Lithium](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme) theme with some minor modifications.

I'm currently a master's student at San Diego State University studying statistics. My main interests are computational statistics, time series analysis, and Bayesian statistics. For the past few months I've been working at Axos Bank as a Data Analyst intern.
