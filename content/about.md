Hi! My name is Andrew Bates and this is my website. It's a place for me to collect and share some of my thoughts on statistics and R. I also use it to record new things I learn in case my future self forgets some of the details. It was built using the R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) using the [Hugo Lithium](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme) theme with some minor modifications.

I'm currently a master's student at San Diego State University studying statistics. My main interests are computational statistics, time series analysis, and Bayesian statistics. Since May 2018 I've been working at [Axos Bank](https://www.axosbank.com/Personal), an online bank, as a Data Analyst intern.
