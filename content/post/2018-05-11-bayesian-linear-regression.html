<p>This is the first of two posts on Bayesian linear regression with a proper prior. In this post I give an overview of the model and how to set up a proper prior distribution using expert knowledge. The next post desrcibes how to sample from the posterior using a Gibbs sampler and using Stan.</p>
<div id="the-model" class="section level3">
<h3>The Model</h3>
<p>In Bayesian linear regression, we model the data as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Y = X\beta + \varepsilon, \hspace{10pt} \varepsilon|\sigma \sim N_n(0,\sigma^2I) \]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is the response and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(n \times r\)</span> matrix of covariates. We can write this model more compactly as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ Y|\beta,\tau \sim N_n\left(X\beta, \frac{1}{\tau} I\right). \]</span></p>
<p>In other words, we model <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> as multivariate normal with mean vector <span class="math inline">\(X\beta\)</span> and covariance matrix <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\tau}I\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensional and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(n \times r\)</span>. This looks a lot like the classical linear regression model but the difference here is that we condition on <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> which are random variables instead of fixed values. We write <span class="math inline">\(1 / \tau\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> which is often done in Bayesian statistics because it makes some of the math easier.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-prior" class="section level2">
<h2>The Prior</h2>
<p>Now that a model is specified for the data, we need to specify a prior distribution for the parameters. There is a lot of freedom here. We can use whatever prior we think captures our prior information. However, we need to be able to obtain a sample from the posterior or we can’t really do anything. Sometimes we use what’s called an <em>improper</em> prior which is not actually a probabilty distribution but gives us a posterior that is. Here we consider a <em>proper</em> prior, so called because we specify a proper probability distribution. We use</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \beta \sim N_r(\beta_0, C), \hspace{10pt} \tau \sim \text{Gamma}(a,b). \]</span></p>
<p>Now comes the tricky part. This prior assumes values for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0, C, a, b\)</span> are given. Of course, we don’t know the values but we need to specify them if we want to actually do anything.</p>
<p>This is where we either need to have our own prior knowledge of the data at hand or have previous data we can use. Otherwise, we need to talk to an expert and try to get enough information out of them to specify the parameters. I consider this the hard case. The expert here is someone who knows about the underlying subject but may not have much knowledge of statistics, let alone Bayesian statistics. And even if they are well versed in Bayesian statistics, we can’t exactly ask them what the covariance matrix is for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> or what the parameter <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is for <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. So we need to ask our expert a series of questions, then use their answers to set values for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0, C, a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="an-example" class="section level2">
<h2>An Example</h2>
<p>To illustrate what questions to ask the expert and how to turn the information into prior parameters, let’s consider an example. The data we will use is on NBA players from the 2015 season. There are 28 variables but we will only consider 4 here. The response is personal fouls (PF) and we are going to model this as a function of steals (STL), blocks (BLK), and minutes (MIN):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ PF|\beta,\tau \sim N(\beta_1 + \beta_2 STL + \beta_3 BLK + \beta_4 MIN, \hspace{5pt} 1/\tau) \]</span></p>
<p>These variables are recorded on a per game basis across the season (i.e. the first player had 0.6 personal fouls per game, 0.3 steals per game, 0 blocks per game, and played 12.4 minutes per game for the 2015 season).</p>

<h3>The Questions</h3>
<p>I don’t really know anything about basketball so I had to consult with someone who does (my brother-in-law). For the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>s, I followed the process described in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Ideas-Data-Analysis-Statisticians/dp/1439803544">Bayesian Ideas and Data Analysis</a>. First, I asked</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the average number of personal fouls per game for someone who has 0.5 steals, 1 block, and plays 10 minutes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expert’s answer was “1-2”. This was great because it actually answers a second question that I would have had to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How big could that be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We need to ask two questions here because <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> has two parameters, the mean and precision. The answer to the first question gives us the mean, and the answer to the second, in combination with the first, gives us the variance. Luckily, both questions were answered in one shot. This series of questions was then repeated for different values of STL, BLK, and MIN<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Since we have four <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>s here, we need to ask four questions.</p>
<p>For the prior on <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, the questions are a bit different. Instead of asking about the mean of the response (PF), we ask about the response itself. Depending on the expert and the data, it may be difficult to take this distinction into account. But we don’t need a ‘perfect’ prior, we just need something that seems to reasonably caputre their knowledge. The questions we ask are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For someone with 2 steals, 2 blocks, and plays 30 minutes<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, what is the biggest number of personal fouls you would expect?</li>
<li>What is the biggest that could be?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We might also clarify first question by adding something like “What is the number of personal fouls that only 5% of players like this would exceed?” The point is that we want to ask about a percentile of the response (in this case the 95th percentile). The answer to the second question then gives us an idea of how much that percentile can vary (so it’s the percentile of the percentile of the data). The answers I got were 4.5 and 5.</p>

<h3>Obtaining the Prior</h3>
<p>Now that we have some numbers but how do we translate that into parameters for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>? We actually asked questions obout things that are easier to think about so we will need to apply some transformations to obtain the parameters we need.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>, we actually asked about the distribution of a percentile of the data. We set the answer to question 1 to the mode of the percentile, and the answer to question 2 as the 95th percentile of this percentile. We then use facts about normal percentiles and gamma distributions to transform these into the mode and 95th percentile of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, then finally <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>. It’s a bit messy to think about but easy to implement in code.</p>
<p>For the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>s, the questions we ask give information about the conditional mean of the response given the number of steals, blocks, and minutes. Specifically, we ask about <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{m}_j = E[Y|\tilde{x}_j, \beta, \tau] = \tilde{x}_j&#39;\beta\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(j = 1,2,\ldots,r\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(r=4\)</span> in this example) . The answers to these questions establish a prior on <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{m} = (\tilde{m}_1, \ldots, \tilde{m}_r)&#39;\)</span> which we assume to be normal: <span class="math display">\[  \tilde{m} \sim N_r(\tilde{Y}, D(\tilde{w})). \]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(D(\tilde{w})\)</span> is a diagonal matrix with <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{w}_j\)</span> as the entries. The components of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{Y}\)</span> are the answers to the first question (average # of personal fouls for players with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> steals, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> blocks, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> minutes play time). The <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{w}_j\)</span>s reflect the variability of the expert’s best guess. These are the answers to the “How big could that be” question. <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{x}_j\)</span> is the vector with given values for the covariates. For example, <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{x}_1 = (1, 0.5, 1, 10)&#39;\)</span> corresponding to 0.5 steals, 1 block, and 10 minutes, plus the intercept.</p>
<p>This is all set up to induce a prior on <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{m}\)</span> is easier to ask questions about and the way it is set up we have <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{m} = \tilde{X}\beta\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(\beta = \tilde{X}^{-1}\tilde{m}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> is the matrix whose rows are <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{x}_j&#39;\)</span>). Since we specified <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{m}\)</span> to be normal, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> will also be normal. We get the parameters by setting <span class="math display">\[ \beta_0 = \tilde{X}^{-1}\tilde{Y}, \hspace{10pt} C = \tilde{X}^{-1}D(\tilde{w})\left(\tilde{X}^{-1}\right)&#39;.\]</span> This induces a normal prior on <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. It will probably help to see this in the context of the data at hand.</p>
<p>For the questions for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, these are the values I got:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \tilde{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 1 &amp; 10 \\
  1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 20 \\
  1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 30 \\
  1 &amp; 2 &amp; 2 &amp; 30 
  \end{pmatrix}, \hspace{5pt}
  \tilde{Y} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1.5 \\ 2.5 \\ 3  \end{pmatrix}, \hspace{5pt}
  \tilde{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2.5 \\ 3.5 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}. \]</span></p>
<p>We already saw the values in the first row of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> and the first components of <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{Y}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{w}\)</span>. Let’s consider the last components. The question would be “What’s the average number of personal fouls per game for someone who has 2 steals, 2 blocks, and plays 30 minutes?” The answer was “3-4” so <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{Y}_4 = 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{w}_j = 4\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Obtaining the Prior (in R)</h3>
<p>If you aren’t quite following, hopefully implementing this in code will help to make things clearer. We’ll start with the prior on <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> because it’s a bit less involved. Below are the computations that perform the transformations mentioned earlier. We use two functions here. The first one, <code>norm_perc_to_sd</code> takes the mean and percentile of a normal distribution and outputs the standard deviation. We need to use this function twice. Once for the initial guess of the percentile, and one for the percentile of this. <code>tau_gamma_params</code> takes the mode and a percentile for a standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and returns the gamma parameters for the precision <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># based on 2 STL, 2 BLK, 30 MIN
norm_perc_to_sd &lt;- function(mean, percentile, p = 0.95){
  sd = (percentile - mean) / qnorm(p)
  return(sd)
}

# mean = 3 b/c Y_tilde_4 = 3
sigma_mode &lt;- norm_perc_to_sd(mean = 3, percentile = 4.5)
sigma_perc &lt;- norm_perc_to_sd(mean = 3, percentile = 5)

  index &lt;- which.max(qgamma(1-p, a, b) &gt; 1 / sigma_perc^2)

  return(out)
}

<p>That takes care of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> so now let’s get the prior for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. We use another function here, <code>norm_params</code>, which takes the mean and percentile for a normal distribution and returns the normal parameters for a mean. We use this to compute the variances for the matrix <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Note that when we create the <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> matrix, we should check that it has full rank as all the above assumes this.</p>
