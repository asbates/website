The idea is fairly simple. To generate a new data set we sample with replacement from the original data until we have a sample of the same size as the original data. But this simplicity comes with a downside. It's often not talked about



Because of its power and simplicity, many people learn about the bootstrap early on in their statistics/data science journey. But then
